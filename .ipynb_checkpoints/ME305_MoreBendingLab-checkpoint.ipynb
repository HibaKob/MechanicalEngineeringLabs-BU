    "Read, but do not yet complete, the  [Experiments](#exp) section. Then discuss within your group and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(1.) Which do you think will produce more deflection: the beam whose layers are bound (Part 1) or the one with the unbound edge at the free end (Part 2)? Or, will the deflection be the same? Why? :</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "...enter your answer here...\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(2.) Describe (qualitatively, in terms of angles, etc.) what you think the end of the beam will look like in each case. :</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "...enter your answer here...\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(3.) In these experiments, self-weight will act as a distributed load. (a.) What would the magnitude of the load be for a cantilever \"beam\" which is just a single sheet of paper? (b.) If it were two sheets completely glued together? (c.) N sheets (essentially your case for Part 1)? :</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "...enter your answer here...\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(4.) Now imagine a cantilever \"beam\" comprised of two sheets of paper that are not glued together. If you used the value you gave for the distributed load of one sheet in (3a.) to predict the beam's deflection, how do you think the prediction would compare to the experiment? What about if you used the value you gave for (3b.)? :</b>\n",

    "...enter your answer here...\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(5.) How would you calculate the second moment of area, I, for the bound beam in Part 1? Is it the same for the one with \"loose\" layers in Part 2? Explain your answer.:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "...enter your answer here...\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>(6.) Do you think Euler-Bernoulli beam theory will accurately predict the deflection $w$ of the beam in Part 1? Why or why not? In Part 2? Why or why not?:</b>\n",
