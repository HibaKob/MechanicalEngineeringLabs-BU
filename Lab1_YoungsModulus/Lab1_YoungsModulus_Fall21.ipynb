        "Perhaps the most fundamental property of a material is: how does it behave when you push or pull on it? Is it stiff like diamond or soft like Jello? The relationship between <b>forces</b> and <b>deformation</b> is fundamental to the study of materials science, engineering mechanics, biomechanics, and physics, and yet when presented with a new material, we are unable to predict this property from theory - <b>we need to measure it experimentally</b>. \n",
        "\n",
        "What is remarkable, is that when the relationship between force and deformation was measured for different materials, a common trend emerged. The [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke) was the first to state the law that relates force to deformation (stretching/compression) in 1678, in which he wrote:\n",

        "In other words, the force required to stretch a spring is proportional to the amount it is stretched: the relationship between force and deformation is <b>linear</b> (as long as the material isn't stretched too much). This law is first encountered for springs, in which we write\n",

        "where F is the force acting to extend/compress the spring, x is the amount of extension, and k is the spring stiffness. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the study of the <i>mechanics of materials</i>, we generalize equation (1) to a similar equation that relates <b>stress</b> to <b>strain</b>. Why? Well, the spring stiffness $k$ depends on both materials <b>and</b> geometry - using equation (1), a thick piece of rubber will have a larger stiffness than a thin piece of rubber, so how do we isolate the <b>material properties</b> of the rubber? The answer is to correct for changes in geometry by measuring an average stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}=F/A$, <i>i.e.</i> force divided by cross sectional area) and the average strain ($\\epsilon_{\\text{avg}} = \\delta/L_0$, <i>i.e.</i> extension or compression divided by the original length), \n",

Young's modulus measures a material's resistance to being stretched or compresses (how hard is it to deform a rectangular shaped material into a bigger/smaller rectangle?). The shear modulus measures a materials resistance to being distorted (how hard is it to distort a rectangular shaped material into a [parallelepiped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped)?). [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio) measures how much a material contracts or expands in directions perpendicular to the direction of applied extension or compression. While there are three properties that characterize a homogenous, only two are independent - <i>i.e.</i> if you measure two, you can calculate the third. For instance, the shear modulus can be calculated once you know $E$ and $\\nu$ by\n",

        "1. Hang your rubber band vertically, so that F = mg, where $g = 9.81 m/s^2$, and m is the mass of the object(s).\n",
        "2. Try to keep your camera angle as consistent as you can (avoid tilting as much as possible), and try to keep the band at the same inclination for all photos -- ideally, it hangs straight down, though this is easier said than done.\n",
        "3. Aim for the rubber band to fill most of the frame. In other words, take your photos from close up (or crop them before importing).\n",
        "4. Never work with pixels, **always convert your measurements to a unit of physical length**, *e.g.*mm.\n",
        "   1. Tip: Put something that you know the physical size of in the photograph.  Then, you can measure the length of that known object in pixels, and convert to a phyiscal unit of measure. Dimensions of various common objects are listed in [Appendix A](#mass).\n",
        "  2. The conversion from pixels to mm might change from picture to picture because your camera might not be the same distance from the sample each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Don't use a known volume of water as your mass. You will almost certainly spill this water everywhere.\n",
        "6. Take measurements of strain using least 5 to 7 different masses. Remember: Hooke's law is valid for **small strains**, so take more of your measurements with small increments of applied force.\n",
        "7. The moduli of most rubbers are between $0.1 \\leq E \\leq 10$ MPa, and the Poisson's ratio are typically very close to 0.5. If your values are very different from these quantities, you have probably done something wrong."
