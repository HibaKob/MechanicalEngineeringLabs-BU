Start by downloading the sample image named \"sample.jpeg\" from the Google Drive folder.\n","\n","Your measurements will rely on directly measuring distances between landmarks in your images. Thus, we should explore options that do not affect the resolution of our image (i.e. the number of pixels per unit length in the image, typically expressed as pixels-per-inch).\n","\n","For example, say I am interested in measuring the length between the red lines on the rubber band in the *sample.jpeg* picture. The image file size is ~3MB which will not work with our code. We can start by cropping the image to the *region of interest* (ROI); we reduce the file size by eliminating pixels that represent parts of the image that we are not interested in. This does not affect the image quality since we have not changed the *resolution* of the image but rather the total *number* of pixels stored in the file.\n","\n","If our ROI is large (e.g. from the highlighter cap to the tip of the keys), then cropping the image to our ROI may not sufficiently reduce the image size. Saving the image in a compressed format makes more sense here, namely in JPG format. This compresses the image by assigning a particular region of pixels (that are of a similar color)  a single value as opposed to saving individual data values to each  pixel (since their pixel values would be approximately equal). Overall, this compression decreases the image quality by storing less specific information about each pixel but also drastically reduces file size without affecting the resolution.\n","\n","See below for an example procedure on how to reduce file size:\n","\n","**MacOS** \n","1.   The builtin application *Preview* can be used to open the image as well as to crop and export.\n","2.   With the image open on *Preview*, click on the *Markup* button at the top of the toolbar.\n","3. Use your mouse to select a region of the image. A *Crop* button will appear on the toolbar.\n","4. Save the image and check the image size. **Note:** this change is permanent so make sure not to crop out any important region of the image.\n","5. To convert the image to JPEG format, press *File* and *Export...*\n","6. Select JPEG from the *Format:* dropdown menu. Here you may slide the bar to select the output image quality. Ensure that the estimate indicates a *File Size:* smaller than **350KB**.\n","\n","**Windows**\n","1. Open image on Paint\n","2. Go to Home section and click on 'select'\n","3.
