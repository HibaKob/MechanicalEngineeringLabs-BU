    "## Introduction \n",
    "What is the shape of a bent beam? This is perhaps one of the oldest and most important questions in all of mechanics. It attracted the attention of some of the greatest minds in mathematics, including Galileo, the Bernoullis, and Euler. It's shape is useful in the design of engineering structures, [shipbuilding](https://www.marineinsight.com/naval-architecture/ship-construction-plate-machining-assembly-hull-units-block-erection/), creating [flexible electronic devices](https://matmatch.com/blog/flexible-electronics-world/), modelling and [animating hair](https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/167/asset/moanaHair_abstract1.pdf) in Disney movies, describing the shape of a [meniscus and a fluid droplet](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~podgornik/download/Analogies-drop-elastica.pdf), and in laying [transatlantic communication cables](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/1/48/pdf), among countless other examples. For a detailed look at the history of elastica, the curious reader may enjoy [this article](https://www.levien.com/phd/elastica_hist.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, the shape of a thin strip of elastic material - an <i>elastica</i> in Latin - is given by same differential equation that describes a pendulum,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d^2\\theta(s)}{ds^2} + \\lambda \\sin[\\theta(s)] = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "    where $s$ is the location along the <i>elastica</i>, $\\theta(s)$ is the angle or slope of the <i>elastica</i> at a given location $s$, that is $\\theta(s)=dw/ds$ where $w$ is the vertical deflection, and $\\lambda$ is the magnitude of applied force to the bending rigidity of the <i>elastica</i>. If we can solve equation (1) for $\\theta(s)$, we will know the shape of a bent bend under what load parameter $\\lambda$ that we apply. \n",
    "    \n",
    "However, equation (1) is very difficult to solve. It is difficult because it is <b>nonlinear</b>, and it is nonlinear because of the $\\sin[\\theta(s)]$ term. When the slopes of the beam are small, we know from the small angle approximation (or, more formally from a Taylor series expansion) that $\\sin[\\theta(s)]\\approx \\theta(s)$ <i>et voila</i> the equation is no longer nonlinear. We a little bit of work, we can manipulate this linear equation into the equation you are more familiar with, the equation of an elastic curve\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "EI \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4}=q(x),\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $EI$ is the bending or flexural rigidity, $E$ is Young's elastic modulus, $I$ is the [second moment of area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area), and $q(x)$ is the distributed load acting transverse or orthogonal to the beam's neutral axis - it has units of force per unit length. This is known as the [Euler-Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerâ€“Bernoulli_beam_theory) beam equation. Here, I have assumed that $E$ and $I$ do not change along the $x$ axis of the beam, otherwise equation (2) becomes a bit more complicated. You may be wondering why we're now taking derivatives with respect to $x$, which is the Cartesian coordinate running along the beam's neutral axis when the beam is <b>undeformed</b>, rather than $s$, which is a coordinate running along the neutral axis of the <b>deformed</b>, or bent, beam. The reason we can use the <b>undeformed</b> configuration, and thus take derivatives with respect to $x$, is because we assumed the <b>slope of the beam is small</b>, and this means that $s\\approx x$. Because this fourth-order [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) is <b>linear</b> (remember, we are assuming the beam is bent, but not too much), it is straightforward to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cantilever beams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever), which are supported (e.g. clamped) at one end and free at the other -- think diving boards -- are especially important. They allow technology like atomic force microscopy [(AFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) to work, and motivated the study of [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and experiments to study the deformation of a cantilever under various concentrated loads."
