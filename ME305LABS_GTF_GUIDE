TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING
##################

Export csv early.

Materials: 
- paperback book/magazine/other floppy book/stack of papers that you can staple or otherwise bind on one edge.
- something to clamp it with (i.e. a stack of other, heavier books)

Collaboration with Zoom and Colab, Shared Drive

Assigning groups

Deliverables

Images with Colab

Image Processing with mpld3

Reference objects 

Format of instructions files

"Dosing" of instructions

Prelab for Labs 2 & 3: can work alone or together?

##################

LSM EDITS:
- check mpld3 in all.
- Remove collaboration instructions
- Add example images to host website and folder (account, so not lost)
- description in each folder of what each ipynb has, including a full version. Objectives and content summary.
- split up Lab 0, move zoom screenshots.

- Add prelab 2 
- Lab 2: don't say M=w'' is most useful. Leave room for piece-wise solution.
- Lab 2: No dataframe manipulations. Make it variables like the previous section. Make a line from min:max P not -- because it depends on the order data points were taken.

- 
- you could just upload the whole lab and tell them to only do part of it?
