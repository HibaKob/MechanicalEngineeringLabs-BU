    "Perhaps the most fundamental property of a material is: how does it behave when you push or pull on it? Is it stiff like diamond or soft like Jello? The relationship between <b>forces</b> and <b>deformation</b> is fundamental to the study of materials science, engineering mechanics, biomechanics, and physics, and yet when presented with a new material, we are unable to predict this property from theory - <b>we need to measure it experimentally</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is remarkable, is that when the relationship between force and deformation was measured for different materials, a common trend emerged. The [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke) was the first to state the law that relates force to deformation (stretching/compression) in 1678, in which he wrote:\n",

    "    <i>ut tensio, sic vis</i> (\"as the extension, so the force\")\n",
    "</blockquote>    \n",
    "In other words, the force required to stretch a spring is proportional to the amount it is stretch: the relationship between force and deformation is <b>linear</b> (as long as the material isn't stretched too much). This law is first encountered for springs, in which we write\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F = k x,\n",
    "\\label{hooke} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $F$ is the force acting to extend/compress the spring, $x$ is the amount of extension, and $k$ is the spring stiffness. \n",
